# highlight words

It highlights words in your text editor with pretty colors based on:

- The length of the word (longer = more red)
- The character code of the first letter (higher = more green)
- The number of instances of the word in the document (more oft repeated = more blue)

## Commands

- "Highlight words" enables highlighting (and updates whenever the document changes)
- "Clear word highlights" clears the highlights and disables automatic updating
